        <p>At Spiro Behavioral Medicine our mission is to provide evidence-based, specialized, hyperaccessible psychotherapy and consultation related to infertility and other reproductive
        concerns. Our goal is to help our clients, their partners, family, and third parties be their most resilient during the process of building a family or making the decision to proceed in another direction. To achieve this end, our therapists, who have a deep grounding in scientificallybased psychotherapy and specialized knowledge of reproductive mental health, provide individual and group counseling.</p>

          To ensure that the highest quality of care is
          widely available and convenient during a period in life with many impingements on time and energy, we offer these services through a stateof- the-art, web-based platform that mimics an in-person, individual psychotherapy session without the hassle or expense of travel to an appointment. While some of our therapists have gone through our own winding journeys to build a family, we recognize that each journey is unique, and look forward to providing support that is at once empathetic, non-judgmental, based in evidence, and couched in deep knowledge of the conceptual, psychological underpinnings related to reproductive health.</p>

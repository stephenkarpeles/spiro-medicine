        <p>Fertility treatment is often an extremely stressful experience. Clients can experience levels of distress similar to that of patients undergoing treatment for cancer.

        <p>Our therapistsâ€™ specialized training in the medical, psychological, and interpersonal aspects of infertility, reproductive medicine, pregnancy, and pregnancy loss ensures that our therapists combine compassion with state-of-the-art knowledge to best partner with you during your journey. Whether you choose a therapist through Spiro, or elsewhere, it is important to be sure that your therapist has the appropriate background, training, and experience to treat you.</p>

          Mind/Body
        </h4>
        <p>
          Our therapists are trained in cognitive behavioral strategies to help minimize distress during treatment. While the evidence as to whether mind/body techniques increase pregnancy rates is mixed, these techniques have been shown to improve the quality of life during treatment, decreasing anxiety, hostility, and distress. Cognitive behavioral strategies address both the thoughts and behaviors that can increase distress, and introduce alternative ways of coping with difficult situations.

          Coping With Loss

        <p>
          Couples undergoing fertility treatments often experience losses ranging from the loss of a pregnancy to the loss of the dream of becoming pregnant in a particular manner. Our therapists have knowledge of the impact of these losses, and can offer support and guidance to best navigate associated grief.

          Decisional Support

        <p>
          With fertility treatments come a number of choices, both those that affect quality of life and those with life-altering potential. While our therapists never make decisions for our clients, our knowledge of best practices in both therapy and the mental health aspects of reproductive medicine allow us to help you navigate these difficult decisions.</p>
